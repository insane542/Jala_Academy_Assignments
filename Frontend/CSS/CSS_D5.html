            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Hot air shimmers over the asphalt.<br>
                After the Bavarian fireball has passed the last bend before the start-finish line, we hear the unmistakeable roar of the V8 engine.<br>
                Tension in the pit lane. Then, finally, certainty: at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March 2001, the BMW M3 GTR, helmed by JJ Lehto and Jörg Müller, finishes on the podium in its first race.<br>
                The team embrace. They all know: This is the start of a new era in American motorsport.<br>
                From now on, this vehicle owns the racetracks of the American Le Mans Series.<br>
                Victories in this series were the highest accolade for the US market.<br>
                But the way there was hard and the effort required enormous.<br>
                The extraordinary story of the BMW M3 GTR.

            <h2>A RACING CAR WITHOUT A PERMIT</h2>
            <p>For the 2001 season, the race-capable BMW M3, officially called the BMW M3 GTR, was ready to roll. The team's trump card was the 4.0-litre V8 high-performance engine with 330 kW (460 hp).<br>
                A full aluminium, naturally aspirated engine with 90-degree bank angle, four valves per cylinder, four overhead camshafts, chain drive and mechanical bucket tappets.<br>
                With this special high-performance power unit under the bonnet, the vehicle was intended to compete in a series-based racing category.<br>
                There was just one problem: The new engine wasn't standard in any series version of the M3.<br>
                Strictly speaking, the M3 GTR was a prototype and so didn't fulfil the homologation regulations for the ALMS GT series.<br>
                Thus, production and sales of a small series of street-legal M3 GTRs had to be undertaken.</p>
